hppGik 2.2 released Thu 26 Feb 2009

	55. Renamed ChppGikStandingRobot::updateDynamics to  ChppGikStandingRobot::updateRobot and changed input arguments.
	54. Fixed free flyer velocity computation (within ChppGikStandingRobot). This should influence ZMP computaion results.

	52. Allowed virtual change of robot root in constraints.
	51. Optimized jacobian computations in constraints.
	50. Split ChppGikSolver in ChppGikSolverBasic (for any linear systems) and ChppGikSolver(for inverse kinematics performed on CjrlDynamicRobot objects). Added class ChppGikBounder for smooth parameter limits observation.
	49. Created hppGik overview documentation and commented code example.
	48. Moved some attribute in private area of ChppGikJointStateConstraint.

hppGik 1.9 released Tue 17 Jun 2008

        47. Fix computation of initial Com in initial right foot frame in
            hppGikStandingRobot.

hppGik 1.8 released Mon 14 Apr 2008

        45. Removed StepPlanner to make it a standalone package
        44. Choosing M_PI as initial value for root's yaw caused
            problems. Reason: velocity computation in
            ChppGikStandingRobot.
        43. Added interpolation of feet yaw
        42. Extra motion time was not properly added
        41. Fix bug in ChppGikMotionPlanElement::jacobian() and value()

hppGik 1.7 released Wed 26 Mar 2008

        40. adapt to version 1.8 of interface-robot-dynamics
        39. ChppGikSingleMotionElement was renamed to
            ChppGikInterpolatedElement
            ChppGikReadyMotionElement was renamed to ChppGikReadyElement
            constructors of the above classes were modified
            constructors of classes deriving from ChppGikLocomotionElement
            were modified
        38. Fix orientation planning.

hppGik 1.6 released Mon 18 Feb 2008

	    previously-imposed extra time at the end of planned motions.
	36. updated ComConstraint according to changes in
	    DynamicMultiBody.
	35. Extra method in GenericTask to enable the user to set the same
	    joints mask for all entered elements.
	34. Added the possibility to use neutral weights for upper body
	    joints in GenericTask.
	33. Added the possibility to select working joints when entering
	    ReadyMotions.
	32. Work In Progress on local locomotion planning.
	31. Split final phase in HalfSittingTask to reset chest prior to
	    other bodies.
	30. Added a foot selection method in HalfSittingTask and
	    StepBackTask.
	29. Bug fix in ChppRobotMotion.
	28. Added const qualifier to numberSamples() in hppRobotMotion.
	27. Two new methods in RobotMotion + imprecision fix.
	26. Many changes resulting in improved memory usage and speed.

hppGik 1.5 released Wed 28 Nov 2007

	25. Added #include "MatrixAbstractLayer/MatrixAbstractLayer.h" where necessary
	    since MatrixAbstractLayer dependency has been removed from
	    robotDynamics.
	24. Optimized code, gikSolver() is about 2 times faster.
	23. Added support for 10ms and 20ms as motion sampling periods.
	22. Fix bug in influencingDofs().

hppGik 1.4 released Thu 08 Nov 2007
