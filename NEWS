New in 2.7, hpp-gik:

* Solvers have been rewritten to make computation faster,
* Changes in interface:
    1. ChppGikRobotTask::solutionMotion() now returns a non const reference to
       ChppRobotMotion,
    2. constructor of ChppGikStandingRobot now takes only a reference to a
       CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot as input parameters. The foot shapes are
       computed from information stored in this object.
       Old constructor is now deprecated,
    3. ChppGikFootDisplaceElement,
       ChppGikStandingRobot,
       ChppGikStepElement,
       ChppGikWalkElement,
       ChppGikZMPshiftElement  constructors take as first argument a pointer
       to ChppGikStandingRobot instead of a pointer to CjrlHumanoidDynamicRobot.

New in 2.6.1, hpp-gik:
* Main page of documentation was not exported anymore in archive. This is fixed.

New in 2.6, hpp-gik:
* The package has been reorganized: names of files are now standard.
